## 10Pearls_shine_internship_project
## Project Overview
Developed an end-to-end Air Quality Index (AQI) prediction system using a fully serverless architecture. Automated data pipelines with GitHub Actions to fetch real-time weather and pollutant data from APIs, and managed features and models through Hopsworks for scalable forecasting.
## Technologies Used 👩🏻‍💻

- **Python**: Core programming language used for data ingestion, preprocessing, and model training.
- **Open-Meteo API**: Provides real-time and historical weather and air quality data for feature generation.
- **Hopsworks**: Used for managing the Feature Store and Model Registry, ensuring consistent data access and version control.
- **GitHub Actions**: Automates CI/CD workflows to run feature extraction and training pipelines on a schedule.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Perform data cleaning, feature engineering, and numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib**: Used for data visualization and trend analysis during model evaluation.
- **Streamlit**: Developed an interactive frontend to visualize air quality insights and model predictions in real time.
